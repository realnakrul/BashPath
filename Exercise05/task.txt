A customer has exported a long list of LDAP user names. These
usernames are stored in the file ldapusers. In this file, every
user has a name in the format cn=lisa,dc=example,dc=com.
Write a script that extracts the username only (lisa) from all of
these lines and write those to new file. Based on this new file, 
create a local user account on your Linux box.

Note: while testing it's not a really smart idea to create the user
accounts directly. Find a solution that proves that the script
works,without polluting your system with many usernames.
