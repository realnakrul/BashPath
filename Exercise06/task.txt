Create a user helpdesk. Write a menu script that is started
automatically when this user logs in. The menu script should
never be terminated, unless the user logs out (which is a menu
option as well). From this menu, make at least the following
options available: (1) Reset password, (2) Show disk usage, (3)
Ping a host, (4) Log out
Bonus question: modify this script and related configuration so
that the user can use sudo to set passwords for other users as
well.
